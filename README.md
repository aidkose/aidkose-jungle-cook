# Jungle Cook
 
Jungle cook is CRUD application where you can (C)reate, (R)emove, (U)pdate, and (D)isplay recipes. On top of creating your own recipes, Jungle Cook also acts as a library that stores your user information and recipes. To get started, users must first login. We store user's content in a firestore database, so that when you come back, your recipes are still there. Only after you login are you able to enter the kitchen and get started creating your own recipes. If you don't have any recipes yet, we offer our own that you can browse through for inspiration (and a good meal). We hope to see you in the kitchen soon!

Misc. Notes - Alerts fire when you create an account, login, sign out, create a recipe, and edit a recipe.

NOTE TO WHOEVER IS GRADING THIS: 
I did my best on this assignment. I struggled with the CRUD Application portion of the assignment. I have a better understanding of it now, but I just couldn't figure out how to implement without redoing everything because at this point I had already sunk in dozens of hours into this assignment as was just tired. I did what I could and I didn't quit, I tried to the end to figure things out. I plan on continuing my work on it over break as I feel it is an important assignment and concept to understand.

GITHUB REPO CHANGE:
Hello Peyton, I wanted to let you know that this GitHub repo is actually different than the one I originally started with, so it doesn't have all of the commits I made up until now. I started using a cloud drive service so I could work on my projects and have them saved while I'm on the go. If you would like to see both repos, I can do that, but this one is the most up to date repo. Sorry if this is confusing, but rather than figure out how to link repos, I just decided to make a new one.
