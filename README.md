# Jungle Cook
 
Jungle cook is CRUD application where you can (C)reate, (R)emove, (U)pdate, and (D)isplay recipes. On top of creating your own recipes, Jungle Cook also acts as a library that stores your user information and recipes. To get started, users must first login. We store user's content in our firestore database, so that when you come back, your recipes are still there. Only after you login are you able to enter the kitchen and get started creating your own recipes. If you don't have any recipes yet, we offer our own that you can browse through for inspiration (and a good meal). We hope to see you in the kitched soon!
